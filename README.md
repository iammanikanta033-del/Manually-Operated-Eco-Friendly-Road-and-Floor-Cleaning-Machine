## 🎯 Objectives  
- Develop a **manual cleaning machine** for roads and floors.  
- Provide an **eco-friendly** alternative to electric cleaning systems.  
- Ensure the machine is **user-friendly, cost-effective, and low maintenance**.  
- Reduce **pollution and energy consumption**.

## ⚙️ Components  
- **Wheels** – Mobility and chain drive connection  
- **Frame** – Main supporting structure  
- **Collector Bin** – Collects debris  
- **Sprockets & Chain** – Transfers motion from wheels to brush  
- **Brush** – Sweeps debris into the bin  
- **Handle** – Adjustable for ergonomic use  
- **Supporting Frame, Mounts, Screws & Bolts** – Stability and assembly  

---

## 🔄 Working Principle  
1. When the operator pushes the machine, the **wheels rotate**.  
2. Motion is transferred through the **chain drive** to the **brush**.  
3. The brush rotates in the opposite direction, sweeping debris into the **collector bin**.  
4. The bin can be detached and emptied as required.
